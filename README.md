## Websites I recommend 
- [cyber threat map](https://threatmap.checkpoint.com/) this website is interesting as it provides live insight on global cyber security attacks. Although the website isnt completeley accurate it is visually appealing and helps you have a better understanding of how prevalent these attacks are.
- [Way Back](https://web.archive.org/) this website is a digital archive of old webpages. Its essentially a museum for the internet.
